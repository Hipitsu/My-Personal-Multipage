    <h1>My Portfolio</h1>

    <p>I am a 20-year-old enthusiastic young person. I'm studying
        At Oulu University of Applied Sciences, information and
        communication technology in my second year.
        I spend a lot of time in my free time
        I like it with friends and at home
        play computer games on the machine as well
        edit pictures and videos. I am very
        interested in information technology fields and
        I hope to be able to in the future
        there. I am very self-starter and
        diligent. I also like to experiment and learn
        everything new. I'm very persistent, and I don't
        immediately give up even if you fail
        would come. I'm eager to get to know you
        to new people and I usually get along with everyone
        get along with.</p>

        <p>Here are also some of my projects:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Arduino Project - In a first year</li>
